# AddCreationTimeToFileName
Videos made by GoPro or drones don't have a name that indicates the creation time of the video. 
This is particularly annoying if you also have some data taken along with the video for multiple time, and you want to aling the video time with the data time. 

This simple c++ code works on windows acquires the creation time and add it to the name.
This is by no means the most elegent solution, but it works for me. 

Suggestions of any kind are welcomed!
